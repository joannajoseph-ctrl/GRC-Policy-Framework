# GRC Policy Framework
This repository houses security policies with the addition of mapping to controls, and a gap analysis. For these policies, I have created the ficitional org 'Pura Health Cloud.' This company has about 100 employees and is a SaaS that stores PHI. The regulatory standard for this organization is HIPAA.

## Compliance Mappings

This repository includes mappings of Pura Health Cloudâ€™s policies to industry frameworks.
