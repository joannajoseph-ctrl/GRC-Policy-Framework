# GRC Project ‚Äì Policies & Compliance Mapping

## Project Overview
This project showcases how Pura Health Cloud can build a foundational information security policy framework and map it to industry standards.  
The goal is to show alignment with the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)** and **ISO 27001**, while also identifying gaps that require remediation.

## Objectives
- Draft core security policies  
- Assign unique IDs to each policy statement  
- Map policies to NIST CSF and ISO 27001 controls  
- Perform a gap analysis to highlight missing or weak controls  
- Recommend remediation steps based on risk rating  

## üìÅ Repository Structure

## Policies
- [Access Control Policy](./policies/01_access_control_policy.md)  
- [Incident Response Policy](./policies/02_incident_response_policy.md)  
- [Data Privacy Policy](./policies/03_data_privacy_policy.md)  
- [Information Security Policy](./policies/04_information_security_policy.md)  

## Compliance Mappings
- [NIST CSF Mapping](./mappings/nist_csf_mapping.csv)  
- [ISO 27001 Mapping](./mappings/iso27001_mapping.csv)  
- [Gap Analysis](./mappings/gap_analysis.md)  

## Methodology
1. **Policy Drafting** ‚Äì Wrote baseline security policies in Markdown with IDs (e.g., AC-1, IR-1).  
2. **Mapping** ‚Äì Linked each policy statement to one or more NIST CSF / ISO 27001 controls using CSV tables.  
3. **Gap Analysis** ‚Äì Identified where policies do not fully satisfy control requirements.  
4. **Remediation Planning** ‚Äì Recommended actions based on the risk level.  

## Why This Matters
A strong policy and compliance mapping process:
- Demonstrates due diligence in security governance  
- Helps auditors quickly validate compliance  
- Identifies gaps before they become findings  
- Provides a clear roadmap for maturing the security program
